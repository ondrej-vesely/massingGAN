# massingGAN

### What is this?
Repository containing code necessary to reproduce results presented in MSc Thesis "Building massing generation using GAN trained on Dutch 3D city models" submitted in June 2022 at TU Delft.


### Why is it empty?
I will upload all the code and files produced during the course of the MSc Thesis during July 2022, once I am done with the main thesis report and defense.
